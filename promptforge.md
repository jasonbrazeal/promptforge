# PromptForge Quickref

Load this file to write and run PromptForge prompts. The repo root is `c:\Users\Vinnie\src\cursor\promptforge`.

## Running a prompt

When the user says `promptforge <name> [input]`:

1. **Gateway.** Check terminals for a running `promptforge-gateway`. If absent, start one in a background terminal from the repo root:
   ```
   cargo run -p promptforge-gateway -- serve local/gateway.toml --profile main
   ```
   Wait for the line containing "serving" before proceeding.
2. **MCP server.** Call `GetMcpTools(server: "user-promptforge")`. If status is not `ready`, check terminals for a running `promptforge-mcp-server`. If absent, start one in a background terminal from the repo root:
   ```
   cargo run -p promptforge-mcp-server -- serve local/mcp-service.toml
   ```
   Wait for the line containing "serving", then re-check `GetMcpTools` until status is `ready`.
3. **Discovery (once per session).** Call `GetMcpTools(server: "user-promptforge")` to learn the tool schemas. Then call `list_prompts` to get prompt names and their input/output metadata. Both stay in context for the session. Only re-call `list_prompts` if the user says something changed.
4. **Call.** Call `run_prompt` with the name from the user's command. Map the user's input to `run_prompt` parameters based on what `list_prompts` reported about the prompt. Do not explore the filesystem, pre-validate, or check whether the prompt exists. Call it. Report whatever comes back.

Steps 1-3 are one-time. Subsequent `promptforge <name> [input]` calls go straight to step 4.

**NEVER read, open, cat, or load any `.env` file into context.** These files contain secrets. The servers load them at startup - the agent must not.

Secrets live in name-matched `.env` files next to their `.toml` configs in `local/`:
- Gateway: `local/gateway.env` (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `BRAVE_API_KEY`, `PROMPTFORGE_GATEWAY_API_KEY`). The gateway loads at most two env files: the profile's (`local/profiles/main.env`) then the boot file's (`local/gateway.env`); the process environment wins over both, and included files' env files are never loaded.
- MCP server: `local/mcp-service.env` (`PROMPTFORGE_MCP_SERVER_API_KEY`, `PROMPTFORGE_GATEWAY_API_KEY`). Flat - one toml, one env file, no chain.

## Components

| Component | Command | Env file | Default bind |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gateway | `cargo run -p promptforge-gateway -- serve local/gateway.toml --profile main` | `local/profiles/main.env`, then `local/gateway.env` (process env wins) | `127.0.0.1:8081` |
| MCP Server | `cargo run -p promptforge-mcp-server -- serve local/mcp-service.toml` | `local/mcp-service.env` (flat, one file) | `127.0.0.1:9310` |

Start the gateway first. The MCP server calls through it.

## `local/mcp-service.toml` (MCP server config)

The MCP server config lives at `local/mcp-service.toml` (gitignored). It serves the directory named in `[paths].prompts`.

- `[catalog]` required: `include` globs relative to `[paths].prompts`. Without it the server finds zero prompts.
- `[tools]` defaults to nothing enabled (true sandbox). Enable per prompt needs.
- `[prompts.NAME]` optional: per-prompt overrides (`enabled = false`).

## `local/gateway.toml` (gateway config)

```toml
[server]
bind = "127.0.0.1:8081"
api_key = "${PROMPTFORGE_GATEWAY_API_KEY}"

[[dominion]]
id = "anthropic"
kind = "remote"
max_concurrency = 10

[[endpoint]]
id = "anthropic"
protocol = "openai"
base_url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
api_key = "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
dominion = "anthropic"

[[model]]
name = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
description = "A model suited for careful analysis, coding, and general assistance"
context = 200000
thinking = "never"
upstream = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
endpoints = ["anthropic"]
```

- `[[local_model]]` for GGUF: `source`, `sha256`, `context`, `gpu_layers`, `flash_attention`.
- `[tools.web_search]`: `provider = "brave"`, `api_key = "${BRAVE_API_KEY}"`.
- `${VAR}` references resolve from the process environment first, then the profile's env file (`local/profiles/main.env`), then the boot file's env file (`local/gateway.env`); earlier sources win, and included files' env files are never loaded. The gateway supports `include` for config inheritance.

## Prompt Structure

- Exactly one **H1** - title + H1 Lua (tool/model resolution)
- Zero or more **H2** sections - executed top-to-bottom; children (H3+) never run by fall-through, only when addressed, and a jump to a child starts a child-level walk that resumes the parent after the jumper
- ` ```lua ` fences for executable Lua; ` ```lua shared ` for a shared library (replays as each section VM's first chunk with the full environment; `jump` excluded)
- Prose outside fences becomes model turns
- `---` as a section's first content marks it off-walk: skipped by the walk, runs only when addressed (`execute`/`jump`/`fanout`); content below the marker executes normally
- `---` anywhere else starts a reader-only comment region (no Lua, no model prose, no list items below it); after a prose line it needs a blank line before it
- Substitution: `{{ args }}`, `{{ var.x }}`, `{{ reply }}`, `{{ x }}` (a section-local bare global)
- Scalar `return` from Lua ends the run

## Lua API

| Function | Effect |
|---|---|
| `tools.bind(alias, desc, override?)` | Resolve a tool by description; `override` sets the model-facing description |
| `tools.always(alias, override?)` | Make a resolved tool available in every section |
| `tools.add(alias, override?)` | Make a resolved tool available in this section; `tools.add({"a", "b"})` for bulk |
| `tools.add_local(alias, desc, params, handler)` | Declare a Lua-backed tool (H2 only) |
| `models.default(alias, desc)` | Declare and set the prompt-wide baseline model |
| `models.bind(alias, desc, opts)` | Bind with options (thinking, context, temperature) |
| `models.use(alias)` | Select a declared model for this section; returns its handle |
| `models.get(alias)` | Return a declared model's handle without changing the section model |
| `models.infer(prompt)` | One tool-free inference round on the section's current model |
| `handle:infer(prompt)` | One tool-free inference round on the handle's model |
| `store.read(path[, start[, end]])` | Read file verbatim, optionally lines `start` to `end` (1-based, inclusive) |
| `store.read_numbered(path[, start[, end]])` | Read with absolute line numbers, optionally lines `start` to `end` (1-based, inclusive) |
| `store.write(path, content)` | Create or overwrite file |
| `store.append(path, content)` | Append to file |
| `store.str_replace(path, old, new)` | Edit by unique anchor |
| `store.delete(path)` | Remove file |
| `store.glob(pattern)` | List matching paths |
| `store.exists(path)` | Check existence |
| `untrusted(s)` | Wrap a string in the untrusted guard envelope |
| `md_to_json(md)` | Chunk markdown into a flat, typed block list |
| `return value` | End run, return value |
| `jump("## Section")` | Transfer control to a visible section (a sibling or a direct child); a child target starts a child-level walk |
| `execute("## Section", input?)` | Start a contained chain at a visible section (a sibling or a direct child); returns the chain's final reply |
| `fanout(worker, collection)` | Map a worker over a collection in parallel; array members arrive as `item`, hash members as pair tables |
| `list_from_section("## List")` | A list section's pre-parsed items as an array - feed it to `fanout` |
| `var.x = ...` | Walk-local state (JSON only); persists across sections on one walk, cloned into `execute`/`fanout` |
| `log(msg)` | Emit to observer |
